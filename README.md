This repo stores code in the process of learning facial recognition technologies including: **MTCNN**, **RetinaFace**, **SSD**, **Dlib** and **Haar Cascade**.

Experimentally, **RetinaFace** and **MTCNN** have the best results, but they are quite slow. If your machine has limited hardware, I recommend running on **Colab**.

**SSD**, **Dlib** and **Haar Cascade** look good with simple pictures, work well on any device. If you don't require high accuracy, this isn't a bad choice.

## Result
This image is detected by **RetinaFace**.
